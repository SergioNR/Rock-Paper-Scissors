// You have not officially learned how to “loop” over code to repeat function calls… 
// if you already know about loops from somewhere else (or if you feel like doing some more learning) feel free to use them. 
// If not, don’t worry! Just call your playRound function 5 times in a row. Loops are covered in the next lesson.
// At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
// Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the docs here if you need to.
// Feel free to re-work your previous functions if you need to. Specifically, you might want to change the return value to something more useful.
// Feel free to create more “helper” functions if you think it would be useful.
